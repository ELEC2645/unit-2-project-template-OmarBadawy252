# ELEC2645 Unit 2 Project Template


This AI application helps you develop your own filter and converter and also has ohm's law included. #There's also a quiz if you want to test yourself. You will be given a score at the end of the test to see how you did. The main.c runs the code. There's a header file that contains the menu items. funcs.c contains the instruction set for each menu item. 

Menu Item 1 is ohm's law calculator used to calculate V or I or R using ohm's law. Menu item 2 is an RC filter design helper finding the necessary value of capacitor to achieve your desired cut off or center frequency and then designs a diagram od the desired circuit. DC-DC converter finds the output voltage of a topology based on the duty ratio value and input voltage. To exit the program, go back to the main menu if you are not already there, and press 5 on your keyboard.
